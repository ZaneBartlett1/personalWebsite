Same exact situation as email. Tried using Thunderbird calendar, but couldn't. Looked at Proton calendar, and am interested. Just havenâ€™t bit the bullet. 

I'm also interested in trying Asana as a calendar. It wouldn't work well for a shared calendar, but they have recently (since July 2023) implemented the ability to schedule things like 2nd Saturday, 3rd Wednesday, etc. For a personal calendar and invites sent to me from others, this works in 90% of my use cases. If you often have to create shared events for others though, this may not work well. I'm unsure how well Proton calendar works for this use case though when other's aren't in Proton mail themselves. It's not a great improvement though as it's not a FOSS solution since Asana is proprietary, but it is one less app for my use case at least.
