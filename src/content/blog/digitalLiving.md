# Purpose
I think a lot of people have like 60-90% of their digital life figured out, but there’s usually something that someone’s not doing that would just make their life easier. Adopting a password manager, doing backups, using a task manager, etc. Then, I also think a lot of people care, to some degree about the following things
* Their own privacy
* Cost
* Supporting Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
* Anxiety
* General curiosity

Then, I like to think that I am good at being reasonable at addressing most of these things in a way that balances thoroughness with reasonability. I want to do this for the following reasons
* I like to help people, and sharing my experiences, compared to some other things, is a lower effort and relaxing activity
* I want to support FOSS where possible, and most of how I live my life digitally uses FOSS, so this is a very good guide at adopting those technologies
* At a large scale I benefit, the more people that are comfortable with technologies like a password manager, the more we can assume sane functions on the internet. This is something that a lot of people may not think about, but anyone who has worked in IT knows what I’m talking about.
* I like to list things out and see if there’s room for improvement. Please, let me know if there’s something here that you think the vast majority of people do on the internet that I missed!
