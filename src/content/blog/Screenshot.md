Flameshot - Good screenshot tool, allows you to mark up the screenshot, something the default screenshot application doesnâ€™t let you do. 

Note from the future: If you use wayland with wayland 22.04, using the draw on your screen extension for markup and then the default screenshot tool, I found is the best way to do things. You can read more [here](https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/issues/649) about the why this is, and I have a comment at the bottom summarizing it.
