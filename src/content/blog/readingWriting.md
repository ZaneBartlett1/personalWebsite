[Marktext](https://flathub.org/apps/com.github.marktext.marktext) - Great tool for reading and writing in markdown, if that’s your thing. If you don’t know or care about markdown, you can probably skip this.

I've also gotten into using Libre Writer. I make reference to this in other parts of my blog, but this is a pretty great video for [going through the settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0che2Az9hw), although it's aimed at making it compatible with microsoft office.
