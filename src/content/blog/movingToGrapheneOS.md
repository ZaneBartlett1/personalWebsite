Moving to Graphene was surprisingly painless, [the setup](https://grapheneos.org/install/web) using the web installer is extremely straightforward and easy, here is a [video of someone going through the process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1KZWjZVnAw). Once the OS is installed though you are on your own a bit. This [video going over the some installation steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1KZWjZVnAw) helped me feel like I was getting the most out of the features. If you haven't heard of grapheneOS is might be good to read about them on their website.
