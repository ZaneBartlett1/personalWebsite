* I’m honestly defeated in this regard and use gmail. I really tried Thunderbird, but could not fix an issue where it took 15 minutes for a message to go out and send. Then another annoying thing I could never fix is that short of manually syncing every time I opened it, I think it would only check for new email every few hours. I have been considering something like proton mail, but just haven’t yet bit the bullet.
