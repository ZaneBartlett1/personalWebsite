* I use Pcloud for backups, but really this is just because they offer a “lifetime” (99 years in contract) purchases of cloud storage. While I am hesitant to think I’ll get 99 years for the price I paid, I only need to get 5 to get a better deal than any other cloud service currently. I trust that it’ll last 5 years. If Pcloud didn’t exist, I’d use Google or Backblaze. I am looking into using Nextcloud at some point, but given that I use my cloud storage as an offsite backup, I would need to figure out a way to run Nextcloud at like a friend's house, which almost instantly becomes more complex than it’s worth. That isn’t to say I am not exploring the idea, but just that I feel like options here are basically limited to either the big cloud companies or the smaller cloud companies and short of the stars aligning, I’ll probably just go with what works.

* Honestly for just cloud storage that I need always available, I just use google drive’s free 15gb since I don’t need this too much.
