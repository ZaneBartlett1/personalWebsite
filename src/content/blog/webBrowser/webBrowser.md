Firefox as the search browser, change these bullet points by going to about:profile, search the bold
* New Windows and Tabs: I set new tabs and new windows to a blank page, this has helped me so much to be able to think. If I need to think, open a new tab. It’s just a blank page with a search bar. This with keywords you don’t need recommendations and it’s just one less thing with too many options.
* Enhanced Tracking Protection: I changed this to strict and literally haven’t encountered a single problem at all. 
Search Engine: DuckDuckGo
Tabs I always have opened and pinned

Notes: 
* Something else that I do is customize my toolbar. I made my search bar one long bar, and removed any extension that I didn’t need to the right to an overflow tray. Customize toolbar is the last option if you right click any extension icon or the refresh button.
* This is pretty cheap, but since I have adblock, if you have a google account you don’t care about, open youtube in a container, sign into that google account, and listen to music there. Now, Youtube only recommends music, and it’s honestly pretty good. The one thing you might need to do is if you accidentally watch an actual video, go to your browsing history and delete it.
