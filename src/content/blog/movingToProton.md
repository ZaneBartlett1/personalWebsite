Moving to proton based services for things like Proton Mail, Proton Calendar, and Proton Drive was mostly fine. The biggest surprise for me was how much I relied on things like google sheets. A lot of getting off Google products was getting things out of drive. I really don't need anything in drive to be as accessible as it was, I mainly just am not a huge fan of the Libre apps. Although once I got them set up they were pretty good replacements.

Proton mail is very close to matching Google mail in a lot of the ways I used it at least. My biggest let down is that while Proton mail has hotkeys, it doesn't have as flexible a set up as Gmail. Otherwise, everything else was good.

I honestly don't have much going on with my Google calendar, so this was a pretty easy change for me. I add things like my doctor and dentist appointments and I'm set.
