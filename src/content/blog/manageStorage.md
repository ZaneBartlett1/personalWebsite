QdirStat - If you want windirstat, but on Linux, this is the best you’re getting. It’s pretty good, and super fast. If you’ve never heard of windirstat and don’t ever care about visualizing your data volume to help determine what to get rid of, you can probably skip this. Although if in the future you want to figure out what’s taking up all your space, this is a great tool!
