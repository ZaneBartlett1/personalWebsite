I just use a Yubikey. These are expensive compared to having nothing, (typically 30-60$ per key, and you typically want two with one being a primary and the other being a backup) but they are actually extremely convenient on top of being one, if not the, safest way to do this. You can buy ones meant to essentially be left in, and you squeeze them to confirm instead of putting in a code. I wouldnâ€™t personally leave one in a laptop (or any mobile device), but a desktop for a WFH situation is totally fine with me.
