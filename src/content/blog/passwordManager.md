I use personal Bitwarden premium (it’s 10/yr), but if I had a family (or was fairly non-tech savvy, if you’re comfortable with things like ctrl-f, ctrl-c, etc, you’re probably good to use bitwarden) I would likely use 1password. Bitwarden is a really great FOSS application, and the cloud option is a great thing, but 1password is just a lot more polished. However, I use premium because I put my TOTP passwords (layman’s terms, they are the 2fa passwords you usually go to an app like google authenticator to get, and they generate a new one every 60 seconds or so.) in bitwarden directly. This does not include my 2fa for bitwarden itself, for that read my next blog post "2FA for my PWM"
