Welcome to my website! A show of my technical skills, I single-handedly developed it using an array of web technologies, including HTML5, CSS, 11ty, Nunjucks, and JavaScript to address any accessibility needs. I'm pleased to say it achieves a perfect Lighthouse score of 400, demonstrating excellent performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO measures.

The site uses Cloudflare for domain and application hosting, chosen for its reliability and robust infrastructure. This not only allows for seamless scalability but also facilitates secure, fast content delivery to users around the globe. As a result, the website maintains consistent performance and availability.

In terms of visual content, the images you see are a blend personal images and carefully selected royalty-free images from reputable platforms like Wikimedia Commons and Pexels.

I focused on responsive design principles during the development process, ensuring that the site functions smoothly across a multitude of devices, from desktops to tablets and mobile phones. By harnessing the power of HTML5 and CSS, I've created a layout that gracefully adapts to different screen sizes, delivering an optimal viewing experience for every user.

In a nutshell, this website is a satisfying personal accomplishment, crafted using HTML5, CSS, JS, 11ty, and Nunjucks, and hosted on Cloudflare for assured performance and availability. The goal of this was to use responsive and accessible designs, enriched by professionally sourced images, to make it a pleasant place to visit, I hope you'd agree.
