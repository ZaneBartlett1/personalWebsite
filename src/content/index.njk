  <h1>Hey, I'm Zane, A Software Engineer from Dallas</h1>
  <p>
    Guided by the words of W. H. Auden, "We are all here on earth to help others; what on earth the others are here for I don't know," I am motivated to persist in the face of challenges and utilize my growing skillset to benefit those in need.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I continue to advance in my career, I am determined to explore and refine my proficiency in machine learning, maximizing the potential of these tools in addressing pressing global issues and contributing to a more stable world.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my downtime, I enjoy cultivating unconventional skills such as billiards, darts, calligraphy, and bowling.
